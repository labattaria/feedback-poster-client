This is the React client, designed and configured for the **Feedback Poster Application**

This client-side app is only part of the application, the second part (the server) is located at this repo: [Feedback Poster Server](https://github.com/labattaria/feedback-poster-server)

The app in this repo is hosted on [![Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/vercel-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white)](#), hosting public URL: [https://feedback-poster-client.vercel.app/](https://feedback-poster-client.vercel.app/)
